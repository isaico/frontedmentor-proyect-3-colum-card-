### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://lenguajecss.com/css/) - This helped me for some css lines that i didn't remember exactly.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.mclibre.org/consultar/amaya/css/css-fuentes-web.html) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand fonts in css. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.(note: the links are in spanish, because I SPEAK NATIVE SPANISH)
